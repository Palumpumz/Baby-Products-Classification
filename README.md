1) I use the Visual Studio Code to write and run code, therefore I recommend you to use the same.
2) There is a trainData.dat in a folder already. 
If you want to use different train data files, please make sure the new file has the same name as I use.
It should be a dat file and should be saved in the same folder as the code file.
The names I used in my code is trainData.dat
3) Make sure you install numpy and scikit-learn.
4) Run the code through terminal. (python hw1.py)

Thank you for reading ReadMe.
